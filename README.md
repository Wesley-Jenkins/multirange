# multirange

Very early design for multi-ranges.

A multi-range is similar to a tuple of range objects.
The library includes functions for modifying multi-ranges which are similar to range operations.

Not recommended to use the multi-range interface manually.
Hopefully this'll get cleaned up quickly.
